Description
Managing studentâ€™s information and sharing them or giving access to unauthorized people in a much secured way is one of the major responsibilities of any academic institution or course provider. Instead of storing the certificates in a normal database, blockchain technology can be used to store the certificates. In this solution, the certificates will be uploaded to the blockchain and will be shared securely when any third party that needs to access and verify the certificates. 

This is done to curb the prevalence of fake academic certificates that are sometimes not detected during the vetting process for different jobs and especially when recruiting candidates in organizations.

Blockchain is a trusted distributed ledger with shared business processes. It has the following desirable features which aid in the resolution of the problem at hand: 
  It is distributed.
  Permissioned.
  Allows for provenance and immutability.
  
### Overview and purpose of the system / product
The objective of the system is to digitize the academic certificates of students/course participants who obtain academic qualifications any institution, in an immutable, non-repudiable and easily verifiable way to contribute to greater transparency and improve efficiency in the verification of academic certificates.
 includes verification of security features built into the certificate such as a digital signature with the original issuer or verification against a centralized database of claims hosted by a third party.
3. **Sharing**: The certificate recipient shares the certificate with a third party.
